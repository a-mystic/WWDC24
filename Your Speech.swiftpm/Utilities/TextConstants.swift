    When giving a presentation, your voice is important.
    You need to practice recognizing whether your voice is trembling or your pronunciation is incorrect.
    Also, non-verbal aspects are important when giving a presentation.
    While speaking your voice, your facial expressions and eye movements will be analyzed at the same time (it's strange if you frown too much or move your eyes too much when speaking).
    Additionally, it is important to write a script and practice your script before you begin your presentation.
    Write a script for your presentation, shorten the parts you think are important, and test whether you present it properly.
    Lastly, during the analysis, a chart appears at the bottom, and there is a secret hidden in it...

    This chapter can be played by two or more people, including yourself and friends or family.
    This chapter will provide you with the ability to correct your presentation posture in the non-verbal aspect.
    The analysis consists of two steps.
    1. ready: Check your posture at the start of your presentation. If the starting position for the presentation is appropriate, after a 5-second countdown, move on to the next stage, the rehearsal stage.
    2. Rehearsal: You rehearse as if you were giving an actual presentation. (Considering users who play alone, the game automatically moves to the feedback screen after 35 seconds. If you have completed your presentation before then, just press the Finish button.)
